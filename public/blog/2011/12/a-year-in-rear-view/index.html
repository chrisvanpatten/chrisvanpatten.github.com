<p>Italy, and the spring and first love all together should suffice to make the gloomiest person happy. <em>– Bertrand Russell</em></p>

<p>It has been a long year.</p>

<p>I opened the year with (what turned out to be) my last <a href='http://kcactf2.org/'>KCACTF</a> festival, directing for the Student Directing Institute. Then I ended up directing and designing <a href='http://www.chrisvanpatten.com/altakesabride/'>my own play at school</a>. Not long after I found myself in New York City working for <a href='http://www.aetn.com/'>A+E Networks</a>, all the while picking up countless freelance design clients like <a href='http://www.lmlmusic.com/'>LML Music</a>, <a href='http://www.cortneywolfson.com/'>Cortney Wolfson</a>, and more.</p>

<p>School in the fall was just as busy. Even though I had commitments to school projects, <a href='http://www.vanpattenmedia.com/portfolio/'>the clients kept coming</a>, and I decided to drop a few projects to focus on web work. And as the end of the semester approached, I decided (1) to focus the spring on growing what was now a fully-formed <a href='http://www.vanpattenmedia.com/'>Van Patten Media</a> and (2) to apply to go on a three week study-abroad trip in Italy.</p>

<p>Phew.</p>

<p>And today, on Monday December 26th, the day of my departure, as I sit awake in a mostly-asleep house typing away, I&#8217;m tired. I am as tired as the year has been long. I truly love my clients, and have been thrilled for the opportunity to work with each and every one of them. I very much believe you learn something from every person you encounter, and my clients have taught me so much.</p>

<p>But man was not made to balance school and work commitments. Even the greats (<em>yes, I&#8217;m reading the</em> <a href='http://amzn.to/tbcKHA'>Steve Jobs</a> <em>book&#8230;</em>) let one slide, and to an extent my focus has certainly shifted in one direction. But I still try to balance. I have one more semester left; I can&#8217;t quit now. It&#8217;s to a point where I have a twitch in my eye that&#8217;s probably caused from all the work. In fact, I just spent a madcap week finishing (or getting to a comfortable place) three major website projects, so I would feel comfortable leaving on this trip.</p>

<p>This trip is all too exciting though. Although it is a study abroad experience, the work takes place in the spring so I can relax, enjoy the sights, and take in Italia. We&#8217;ll see Naples, Rome, Pompeii, and dozens of sights throughout the course of the three weeks. In the second week of the trip, we have a two night break; I&#8217;ve booked a fairly cushy hotel so I can just relax. And before I come home, I&#8217;ll be spending a night in London where I&#8217;m planning to visit friends and see the West End production of <a href='http://www.matildathemusical.com/'>Matilda the Musical</a>. This vacation is for me.</p>

<p>There are a lot of exciting things coming for <a href='http://www.vanpattenmedia.com'>Van Patten Media</a>. As I keep reiterating (because it is true) we have absolutely mind-blowingly awesome clients. In 2012, I&#8217;m focused on growing our corporate clients, to help boost our bottom line. We&#8217;ve just <a href='http://www.github.com/vanpattenmedia'>open sourced two projects</a>, and have more on the way in the new year.</p>

<p>In order to make it all happen though, I need a break. A little time to stop, re-evaluate where I am, where I am going, and how best to get there. I&#8217;m bringing my copy of <em>The Four-Hour Workweek</em> (after just working a 90 hour week, I like the sound of it). I&#8217;ll have my ebooks of <em><a href='http://amzn.to/vW2fE3'>Zen Mind, Beginner&#8217;s Mind</a></em> (<a href='http://lumsa.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/zen_mind_beginners_mind.pdf'>free PDF</a>), <em><a href='http://amzn.to/t8XkuE'>Mindfulness in Plain English</a></em> (<a href='http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe.html'>free ePub/PDF</a>), and <a href='http://inoveryourhead.net/'>Julien Smith</a>&#8217;s <em><a href='http://www.amazon.com/The-Flinch-ebook/dp/B0062Q7S3S/'>The Flinch</a></em> (it&#8217;s just free, so go read it). I will be resting and recharging, but I will also be deep in thought, planning and plotting for the year to come.</p>

<p>Oh, and of course I&#8217;ll also be enjoying all the excellent food. Because at the end of the day, it <em>is</em> Italy. That&#8217;s really what this trip is going to be all about.</p>

<p>Ciao!</p></div>
