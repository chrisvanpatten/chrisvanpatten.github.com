					<div class="entry-content"><p>I recently switched cold turkey to <strong><a href='http://www.vim.org/'>Vim</a></strong>, in the first part of an effort to move my development environment to apps I could use (in theory) everywhere and trust to have in place for a long time. Sublime Text 2&emdash;which I mentioned using in my <a href='http://www.chrisvanpatten.com/blog/2012/06/dev-setup/'>dev setup</a> post&emdash;is great, but it&#8217;s only maintained by oe guy, it&#8217;s expensive at $60 for a license, and not available on servers because it&#8217;s a GUI-based app.</p>

<p>Vim has been around for (literally) decades&emdash;over 20 years, in fact. There&#8217;s no doubt its development is stable and it&#8217;ll be reliably available. It&#8217;s free software (as in beer and speech) and it has an active developer community contributing plugins and neat new improvements. Plus, Vim&#8217;s unique syntax (once you master it) makes you faster and more efficient than any other text editor available.</p>

<p>I was also interested in running Vim inside <strong><a href='http://tmux.sourceforge.net/'>tmux</a></strong>, a terminal multiplexer describing itself as an alternative to GNU Screen. A terminal multiplexer provides a nice alternative to tabs in your terminal emulator (like iTerm or Terminal.app) because</p>

<ul>
<li>&#8220;Sessions&#8221; are persistent - meaning you can close, or &#8220;detach&#8221; yourself from a session, and it will (essentially) be frozen while you&#8217;re gone. Particularly useful for saving your place when working with a server.</li>

<li>You can actually have multiple panes visible at once, making it easier to see a several different tasks at once.</li>
</ul>

<p>With Vim and tmux working side by side, I would be able to edit in one pane, see my asset compilation in another pane, monitor server stats in another tmux tab, and have <code>git status</code> visible in another pane. Sort of an ultimate developer HUD.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Vim and tmux don&#8217;t play nicely out of the box. They both require lots of keyboard shortcuts to work, and even once you&#8217;ve remapped them so there are no conflicts (your first order of business if you&#8217;re having trouble) you might still have problems with things being sent incorrectly. In particular, I had trouble with the arrow keys. I use them to navigate between Vim panes, and it was driving me mad not being able to move around fluidly!</p>

<p>After lots of searching around the web though, I finally found two lines of config that were able to get Vim and tmux working together like long time best friends. Arrow keys now work flawlessly! <strong>Here&#8217;s what I did:</strong></p>

<p>First, in your .vimrc: <code>map &lt;Esc&gt;[B &lt;Down&gt; </code></p>

<p>And then in your .tmux.conf: <code>set-window-option -g xterm-keys on</code></p>

<p>It&#8217;s important to note that this assumes you have tmux reporting itself as an xterm-compatible terminal (for best color compatibility, you probably should anyway). But once you do this, your problems should evaporate and you&#8217;ll have an awesome terminal-based development environment going.</p></div>
