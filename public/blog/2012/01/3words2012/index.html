					<h2 id="post-title">Three words for 2012</h2>

					<div class="entry-content"><p><img alt='' src='http://www.chrisvanpatten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-shot-2012-01-04-at-19.13.12-300x273.png' />Chris Brogan has an <a href='http://www.chrisbrogan.com/3words2012/'>annual tradition</a> where he decides three words that will guide him through a new year. Think of it as a broader alternative to New Year&#8217;s resolutions. A lot of <a href='http://www.cc-chapman.com/2012/3-words-for-2012/'>awesome people</a> have followed suit since.</p>

<p>I thought I&#8217;d join in with a few of my own that I&#8217;ve been mulling over. It&#8217;s a little late being that it is after January 1st, but I&#8217;m still in the early stages of formulating the upcoming year because of my ongoing trip to Italy (and Mike Vardy outlined some <a href='http://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/why-you-should-start-your-new-year-in-february.html'>great reasons why you might do the same</a>, even if you aren&#8217;t vacationing abroad).</p>

<p>So here are my words, carefully considered, for the year ahead.</p>

<h2 id='income'>Income</h2>

<p>This one is an easy one. This is my first year of committing fully to <a href='http://www.vanpattenmedia.com/'>Van Patten Media</a>, and I need to make it a successful one to prove the business can survive (and start paying off those pesky college loans). I&#8217;m confident I can do it with a little hustle and a lot of the same high quality work.</p>

<h2 id='adventure'>Adventure</h2>

<p>This word didn&#8217;t come so easy. At first, it was <strong>risk</strong>, a word that definitely embodies a lot of what I&#8217;m looking to accomplish here, but at the end of the day <strong>adventure</strong> better captures the spirit of my goal. All too often, I resign myself to safe, boring days and constant work. In the next year (and beyond) I want to make sure to balance my workaholic personality with a healthy dose of <strong>adventure</strong>. Spur-of-the-moment trips, being more open to excitement and chance-taking, and generally stepping out of my comfort zone will aid in my pursuit of new experiences.</p>

<h2 id='mindfulness'>Mindfulness</h2>

<p>I need to find an emotional center in my life and be more present, aware, and happy with myself. <strong>Mindfulness</strong> is a technique to help accomplish this, and also a word that I think embodies the end goal. My recent dabbling with various Buddhist practices after reading the books of (<a href='http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2010/mar/10/buddhism-atheism-hitchens'>Hitch-approved</a>) author Stephen Batchelor (like <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1573226564/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrvanpat-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1573226564'>Buddhism Without Beliefs</a>) have excited me about the possibility of &#8220;tuning up&#8221; my mind and becoming more at peace with who I am and who I am becoming. I&#8217;m only 21–a tumultuous time in a person&#8217;s life–and I am incredibly eager to find an emotional anchor in my life.</p>

<p>So those are my three words. What are yours? <strong><a href='http://www.chrisvanpatten.com/blog/2012/01/3words2012/#respond'>Leave a comment</a></strong>or write your own post and send it my way!</p></div>
