					<div class="entry-content"><p>Today at <a href='http://barcamproc.org/'>BarCamp Rochester</a> I gave a talk outlining some of the awesome features of <a href='http://sass-lang.com/'>Sass</a> and <a href='http://compass-style.org/'>Compass</a> (the style sheet preprocessor and the preeminent framework built for it, respectively) with lots of examples and lots of code.</p>

<p>The slides are <a href='http://www.chrisvanpatten.com/talks/ssssc/'>online here</a> (built with <a href='http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/'>DeckJS</a>). They discuss some basic Sass features and some additions Compass brings to the table as well.</p>

<p>Considering the fairly dense nature of the material and the speed I had to rush through them, I think the talk was fairly well received. If I could have another go (and I may soon) I would consider reformatting the presentation so it&#8217;s less &#8220;here&#8217;s a feature, here&#8217;s another feature, and yet another feature&#8221; but instead connects the features so you get a better sense of how they&#8217;re used in a workflow. Demonstrating the process of building of a page in realtime with Sass and Compass would be more fun and accomplish this, but it would have to be carefully scripted.</p>

<p>I left out three major things in the discussion (but touched briefly on one of them):</p>

<ol>
<li><a href='http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#partials'>Partials</a></li>

<li><a href='http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#syntax'>Sass vs. SCSS syntax</a></li>

<li>Getting started (installation <a href='http://sass-lang.com/download.html'>for Sass</a> and <a href='http://compass-style.org/install/'>for Compass</a>)</li>
</ol>

<p>I&#8217;ve linked to some resources above that will guide you to the right places for beginning your own exploration of those topics.</p>

<p>I had a great time at BarCamp Rochester, reconnecting with folks from the Rochester tech community and hanging out with friends from Buffalo. And the swag is awesome: I walked away with three new t-shirts (thanks BarCamp Rochester, Puppet Labs, and Stack Overflow!), many new stickers (thanks jQuery UI, Puppet Labs, and Stack Overflow!) and a killer beer stein (thanks Stack Overflow!).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m already looking forward to the next BarCamp, and hopefully we can get one running in Buffalo regularly again soon!</p></div>
