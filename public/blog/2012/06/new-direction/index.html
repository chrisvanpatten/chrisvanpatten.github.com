					<div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s been only a few months since I last tackled redesigning ChrisVanPatten.com. It was a spur of the moment thing (it usually is) in the middle of <a href='http://barcamproc.org/'>BarCamp Rochester</a>. While the previous design was <em>okay</em> (it was brimming with my trademark simplicity) it wasn&#8217;t quite what I wanted. And frankly, while I hoped a redesign would encourage me to blog a bit more, it didn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ve decided to try again, and this time not only have I completely redesigned, I&#8217;ve actually switched blogging engines. I&#8217;m now using the flexible and powerful static-site generator <strong><a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll'>Jekyll</a></strong>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now hold on,&#8221; you, the client who frequently comes to me for WordPress-related services, might say. &#8220;Why are you using this <em>Jekyll</em> thing? I thought you were a WordPress guy?&#8221;</p>

<p>In a nutshell, I am a WordPress guy. I love and evangelize the platform, and I&#8217;m excited to be helping to organize the upcoming WordCamp in Buffalo this October. WordPress is the foundation of <a href='http://www.vanpattenmedia.com'>Van Patten Media</a>, and I don&#8217;t see that changing any time soon.</p>

<p>Still, that doesn&#8217;t change the fact that, at the end of the day, I did make a switch. My reasons are thus:</p>

<ol>
<li>I love <strong>Markdown</strong>. Formatting text in Markdown is far more pleasant than HTML (and I can still use HTML if I so choose), and means I can write posts in just about any environment, whether I have Microsoft Word or a simple command line.</li>

<li>It&#8217;s geeky! Jekyll is straightforward to set up, but it&#8217;s for geeks first. It&#8217;s fun to play around with, and it tickles my geek bone.</li>

<li>We&#8217;re working on <a href='https://github.com/vanpattenmedia/vanpattenmedia.com'>building a new deployment architecture</a> at VPM, and the majority of it is based on Ruby. Working with Jekyll, one of the prototypical Ruby applications, is a great way for me to familiarize myself with Ruby and &#8220;the Ruby way.&#8221;</li>
</ol>

<p>WordPress continues to be my platform of choice for clients and my business, and I don&#8217;t forsee that changing any time soon.</p>

<p>So I hope you enjoy this new (fully mobile-friendly) design. It was fun to put together, and I&#8217;m excited to get back into blogging.</p>

<p><em>P.S. I haven&#8217;t installed any comments modules (e.g. Disqus) for the redesigned site. I&#8217;ve decided I&#8217;d much rather keep conversation in email or Twitter. I&#8217;ll be looking into ways to integrate those discussions here soon!</em></p></div>
