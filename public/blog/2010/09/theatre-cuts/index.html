					<div class="entry-content"><p>The Buffalo News <a href='http://www.buffalonews.com/city/communities/erie-county/article204371.ece'>reported today</a> that Erie County commissioner Chris Collins is planning to slash funding for culturals in next year&#8217;s budget, specifically noting:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span>&#8230;</span> his budget would end county dollars for, among others, the Alleyway Theater, the Irish Classical Theatre Company and Shakespeare in Delaware Park, one of the nation&#8217;s largest free outdoor Shakespeare festivals. In fact, no theater companies are among Collins&#8217; 10 recipients.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Harsh.</p>

<p>There are few excuses for this action (Jennifer Smith is right to call the cuts &#8221;<a href='http://allthingsjennifer.wordpress.com/2010/09/29/dear-county-executive-chris-collins-this-is-unacceptable/'>unacceptable</a>&#8221; <em><strong>Edit</strong>: well, she did call them unacceptable, looks like she&#8217;s password-protected the post</em>) but it needs to serve as a cautionary tale for other companies in Buffalo and elsewhere&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>These cuts are just the beginning.</strong></p>

<p>Either do a better job of educating the public about the impact your organization has, making a case for the public money (the Greater Buffalo Cultural Alliance is quoted in the News article to this effect, but doesn&#8217;t have a website with stats, numbers, etc.) or change your business model to a self-sufficient one that can separate you from the need for public money.</p>

<p>Any other path will inevitably lead to disaster.</p></div>
