					<div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve recently started reading Danny Newman&#8217;s seminal &#8220;Subscribe Now&#8221;, the book that essentially defined the business model for non-profit culturals in the back half of the 20th century. Newman is sort of like a revivalist preacher proclaiming the wonders of &#8220;DSP&#8221;, aka &#8220;Dynamic Subscription Promotion&#8221;, advocating loudly and forcefully for the power of subscription in the American cultural.</p>

<p>He has the numbers to justify his excitement for subscription, at one point (I believe in the foreword) it&#8217;s noted that he sold several thousand subscriptions for a theatre company that hadn&#8217;t even opened its doors yet. Impressive.</p>

<p>But my initial impressions of Newman&#8217;s DSP technique (not necessarily of subscription in general, though I&#8217;ll get to that) is that it&#8217;s nothing surprising or earth-shattering. The stories he&#8217;s telling are of companies who had subscription plans (or didn&#8217;t) and just had no concept of how to properly promote them. What a surprise then, that when he came in and appropriately marketed for these groups, their subscription sales substantially increased.</p>

<p>He clearly states that the problem was not in the subscriptions, but in the marketing (and administration). And certainly he was proven right. As I mentioned previously, his methods were the most important cornerstone in a theatre&#8217;s business model as regional/resident theatres began appearing in the late 50s and 60s.</p>

<p>But is it relevant today? Are subscriptions as important to theatre today as they have been over the past 50 years? According to the TCG&#8217;s 2009 Theatre Facts publication (<a href='http://www.tcg.org/pdfs/tools/TheatreFacts_2009.pdf'>PDF link</a>) subscription sales are at a five year low, and it seems to me that the trend is likely to continue.</p>

<p>Why? The same reasons Newman encountered, I suspect, form the base of the problem. Old patrons who grew up with the resident theatres are aging rapidly, dying, and leaving behind subscriptions. It&#8217;s morbid, yes – but I suspect it&#8217;s the prime cause of subscription drops. But that generation is giving way to a new generation (mine) which is severely different. The subscription model doesn&#8217;t work for &#8220;us&#8221; because we have different expectations – <strong>we are the on-demand generation.</strong></p>

<p><strong>(OOH CLIFFHANGER! I&#8217;ll continue the rest at some other point in my life. Stay tuned&#8230;)</strong></p></div>
