<p>I recently got a Netflix account on a free trial from a friend. It has instant streaming.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s awesome.</p>

<p>The instant streaming feature alone is worth the price of admission (which, for the time being, is zilch for me). The first movie I watched on Instant Streaming was the 2008 film <strong>Doubt</strong>, starring Meryl Streep, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams, and Viola Davis.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d seen it in theatres, but seeing it again reiterated the initial impressions I had of the movie. As a friend said, it&#8217;s a &#8220;battle of the actors&#8221; - throw the finest film actors of our day on screen and see who comes out on top. In this case, everyone wins, but I wonder at what cost. The ambiguity that made the stage play so powerful is lost in the film, perhaps in part to the crispness of the performances, or Shanley&#8217;s very composed, angular visual style. The actors are at the top of their game, but to a degree they go <em>too</em> far, and while it&#8217;s still a compelling story, it loses the mystery that made it so much more on stage.</p>

<p>I still grant it four stars - these actors are at their technical peak, and watching their layered characterizations (in spite of how clean or meticulous they may seem) proves that.</p></div>
