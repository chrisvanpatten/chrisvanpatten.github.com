I'm preparing for what (hopefully) turns into a semester of directing. Very excited about the prospect.

I'm currently scoping out short plays, and have checked out 11 editions of the crucial "Best American Short Plays" series from our library at school. While I scope out the plays in here, I thought I'd also put the question to the web... anyone have ideas on short (sub-45 minute) plays that are good for a collegiate environment?
