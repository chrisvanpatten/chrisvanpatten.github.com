Chris Van Patten is the founder and creative director at Van Patten Media, which helps artists, entertainers, and arts organisations get the web working for them. He is based in New York City.

## Theatrical, energetic, and intimate

Everything Chris Van Patten talks about is focused on simplifying: how web designers can simplify user experiences, the power of streamlining your todo list through digital delegation, etc. A self-proclaimed "minimalist", Chris translates that philosophy into the digital realm, and focuses on how it can make you more productive as a developer, business owner, or web consumer.

Chris's background in the theatre (he has a degree in it) means every talk is engaging, intimate, and inspiring. Every talk is designed to contain a Q&A component, giving your audience an opportunity to talk back and engage deeper.

Chris has spoken at multiple BarCamps, WordCamps, meetup groups, and more. [See a full list below.](#past_talks)

## Prepared Talks: General

**Outsource Your Blog** _(For Fun & Profit)_ &mdash; In this age of "content marketing", you need to have great content on your website. But if you run a small business or manage multiple blogs, it can be easy to get overwhelmed by the pressure to prepare that content. Fortunately services like Elance, Fiverr, and oDesk make it easy to find talented folks to ease your workload. You'll learn how to search out and hire writers, researchers, proofreaders, and virtual assistants to make your blog content-heavy and stress-free, without breaking the bank.

**Uninstall That App!** _Be more productive by removing digital distractions_ &mdash; Reducing the number of apps you use, shutting off notifications, and limiting digital consumption can actually make your life easier. Learn the philosophy behind digital minimalism and how it can help you destress, detox, and focus on the things you love.

## Prepared Talks: WordPress-specific

**Developing a Client-Focused Admin Panel** &mdash; The WordPress dashboard is complex and difficult to work with for the average non-technical user. Chris will show you how to make it easier to use without compromising flexibility.

**Front-End Forms & Other Fun** &mdash; Let your users submit content, edit profiles, and moreâ€”without ever seeing the WordPress dashboard! I'll walk your audience through building forms, form validation, and how to process that data on the server. (And we'll see how a little basic PHP knowledge can go a long way in WordPress development.) _Code heavy._
