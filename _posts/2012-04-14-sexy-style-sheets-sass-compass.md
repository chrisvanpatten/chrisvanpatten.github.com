Today at [BarCamp Rochester](http://barcamproc.org/) I gave a talk outlining some of the awesome features of [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) (the style sheet preprocessor and the preeminent framework built for it, respectively) with lots of examples and lots of code.

The slides are [online here](http://www.chrisvanpatten.com/talks/ssssc/) (built with [DeckJS](http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/)). They discuss some basic Sass features and some additions Compass brings to the table as well.

Considering the fairly dense nature of the material and the speed I had to rush through them, I think the talk was fairly well received. If I could have another go (and I may soon) I would consider reformatting the presentation so it's less "here's a feature, here's another feature, and yet another feature" but instead connects the features so you get a better sense of how they're used in a workflow. Demonstrating the process of building of a page in realtime with Sass and Compass would be more fun and accomplish this, but it would have to be carefully scripted.

I left out three major things in the discussion (but touched briefly on one of them):

1.  [Partials](http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#partials)
2.  [Sass vs. SCSS syntax](http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#syntax)
3.  Getting started (installation [for Sass](http://sass-lang.com/download.html) and [for Compass](http://compass-style.org/install/))

I've linked to some resources above that will guide you to the right places for beginning your own exploration of those topics.

I had a great time at BarCamp Rochester, reconnecting with folks from the Rochester tech community and hanging out with friends from Buffalo. And the swag is awesome: I walked away with three new t-shirts (thanks BarCamp Rochester, Puppet Labs, and Stack Overflow!), many new stickers (thanks jQuery UI, Puppet Labs, and Stack Overflow!) and a killer beer stein (thanks Stack Overflow!).

I'm already looking forward to the next BarCamp, and hopefully we can get one running in Buffalo regularly again soon!
