When you're ordering something online, include a gift note (it's usually free) with a positive message to yourself. Something like "Smile, buddy! It'll all be okay!" or "Don't worry, be happy!"

When you get your package, open it up and see the note, I dare you not to smile. What a fun way to cheer yourself up!
