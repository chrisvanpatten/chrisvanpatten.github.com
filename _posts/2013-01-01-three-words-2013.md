name: Three words for 2013
---

Last year, I shared [three words I would use to guide the new year](http://www.chrisvanpatten.com/blog/2012/01/3words2012/). This year, I'm carrying on the tradition with three more words that I plan to use as my themes for 2013.

### Action
Action will inspire me to be bold, to take risks, and to ultimately commit to making real change. I tend to overthink problems and challenges; this word reminds me to stop thinking and start doing.

### Spontaneity
Similar to action, I need to be quicker to commit to my impulses. Whether it's trusting my design instinct or going out with friends on a whim, being spontaneous will keep me on my toes and engaged in life.

### Organisation
Particularly in relation to [Van Patten Media](http://www.vanpattenmedia.com/), I want to be better about organising information of all kinds. We work with a large number of clients relative to the size of the company, and can get quickly bogged down in passwords, invoices, contracts, security logs, and more. I hope to introduce new organisational systems that will improve our response times and effectiveness.

So those are my three words for 2013. What are yours?
