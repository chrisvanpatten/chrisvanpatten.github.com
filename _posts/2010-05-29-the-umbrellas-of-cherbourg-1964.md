5 Stars

At first, I was a bit worried about this 1964 French romance. Although I'm an admitted musical theatre dork, and "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg" ("[Les parapluies de Cherbourg](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058450/)") is admittedly a musical film, something about it had me on edge. Perhaps it's because it isn't a film musical in the traditional sense: there are no choreographed songs (the title sequence notwithstanding) and really there are not even "songs." The dialogue is presented as recitative, a la opera, and I had trouble getting around the awkwardness of this device.

But as time wore on, I became engrossed and captured. When you open yourself to it, you can see that Jacques Demy has created a colorful French world straight out of our imaginations, where we all speak in glorious melody, where love is pure and beautiful (and musical), and where wrong against love cannot be committed.

Or so it seems.

It's when the main characters (Guy and Geneviéve, played by [Nino Castelnuovo](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0144875/) and the beautiful [Catherine Deneuve](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000366/), respectively) are thrust apart and forced into separate lives that the film takes on a depth and even bitterness that, really, we could only experience in a French romance. And in the film's (arguably famous) final scene the air becomes tense, and the emotion the characters are forcing back is palpable.

Driven by Michel Legrand's glorious score (and the hauntingly beautiful "I Will Wait For You" theme, which has stayed with me for days), "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg" is a stunning romance that will grab hold of your heart and pull you along for its highly emotional ride.

5 out of 5 stars.
