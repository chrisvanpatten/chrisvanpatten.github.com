Since we [last spoke](http://www.chrisvanpatten.com/blog/2013/06/hiring-your-first-virtual-assistant/), things have been pretty busy for me, and I wanted to share a quick update about all of the new projects I'm working on.

First up: introducing [Not a Real Job](http://www.notarealjob.com/), a new podcast I'm starting with my pal [Joel Kelly](http://twitter.com/joelkelly). Not a Real Job is a sort-of-advice-podcast aimed at helping small business owners and entrepreneurs get more from their digital marketing efforts. This podcast is a bit unique because it's a subscribers-only podcast: we charge $4 per month and $40 per year. It's a bit of an experiment, but we'll see how it goes. We already have 3 episodes recorded and plan to continue!

Also in podcast-land is my new podcast [Wrapp Up](http://wrappup.com/). I use a _lot_ of apps in my day-to-day routine, and I thought a podcast would be a fun way to share and discuss those apps. The podcast is only about 5â€“6 minutes per episode, so it's easy to digest. It's a lot of fun to record, and I plan on releasing it weekly. The first episode drops this Thursday, at [wrappup.com](http://wrappup.com/).

I've also recently launched a new web project called [StudioSleuth](http://studiosleuth.com/). I alluded to it a bit in my post about [virtual assistants](http://www.chrisvanpatten.com/blog/2013/06/hiring-your-first-virtual-assistant/) (the content was largely researched/entered by my assistant) but haven't formally announced it. Essentially, StudioSleuth is a great way for actors to find rehearsal studios. We catalog locations, rates, contact details, and also support reviews. It's a simple concept that I hope has legs.

And of course, there's a lot in the hopper too. I'm sketching out a new web service for helping auditioning actors, and have a few theatrical productions I'm working on. Up next, I'll be designing projections for [Drew Gasparini at Joe's Pub](www.joespub.com/component/option,com_shows/task,view/Itemid,40/id,5657), and am co-producing a [concert of Sondheim music](www.lepoissonrouge.com/lpr_events/the-bluest-ink-a-multimedia-revue-staged-in-concert-august-26th-2013/). I'll have more to share about the Sondheim concert soon.

Thanks for tuning in, as always. Be sure to [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/chrisvanpatten) if you don't already (you probably do) and as always you can [email me](mailto:hello@chrisvanpatten.com) with questions, comments, concerns, or leads on free food.

P.S. I know I owe ya'll a sequel to my post about [virtual assistants](http://www.chrisvanpatten.com/blog/2013/06/hiring-your-first-virtual-assistant/). Hang tight, it's coming.
