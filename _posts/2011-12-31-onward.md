Looking back, 2011 was a rollercoaster. I thought I'd take a moment to focus on the ups... who and what I'm thankful for, particularly over the past 365 days.

I'm thankful for:

  * [Peter Upfold](http://www.peter.upfold.org.uk/): an incredible developer and friend who makes Van Patten Media possible. I cannot understate his commitment to the team; he is truly essential. In the next year or two, I truly hope I can get to a point where he can be brought on full time.
  * The amazing community of people smarter than me at [Twitter](http://cvp.me/twitter) and [Google+](http://cvp.me/googplus). From the folks I interact with regularly ([Paddy](http://twitter.com/paddyforan), [Kevin](http://twitter.com/kevinddaly), [Jason](http://twitter.com/endonend), etc.) to the folks I learn from ([C.C.](http://twitter.com/cc_chapman), Â [Chris](http://twitter.com/chrisbrogan), [Becky](http://twitter.com/beckymccray), [Keith](http://twitter.com/keithburtis), etc.).
  * The opportunity to be in Italy for the new year. These past few days have been cleansing and relaxing, and I'm excited for the next two weeks.
  * My best friend and "little sister" [Sara Elizabeth](http://www.saraelizabethmusic.com/). She keeps me from going crazy!
  * [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org/): it provided a foundation on which to build a business, and I am excited to give back in the new year.
  * [Kevin Daly](http://theatreaficionado.com/): he keeps me sane as well!
  * And finally, [my incredible clients](http://cvp.me/web) who have made this year (and this incredible trip) possible.

Here's to a happy, healthy new year. See you on the other side...
