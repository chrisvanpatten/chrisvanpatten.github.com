title: Using your Virtual Assistant - Delegation 101
---

So after a lengthy process, you finally [hired your virtual assistant](http://www.chrisvanpatten.com/blog/2013/06/hiring-your-first-virtual-assistant/) (following the advice in my last post on the subject). The big question now is "what next?"

The answer is simple: start delegating!

## Analyse your workflow

The first step (and one that you should probably complete before considering hiring) is to **analyse your workflow** for opportunities to delegate work. Start compiling a list of the things you get done throughout a given day (or a clump of days). No task is too small to include, and you should be as specific as you can.

At the end of the day (or the week), break this list down into three categories:

1. Tasks that only you can complete
2. Tasks that someone else could complete
3. Tasks that someone else could complete if they were modified/simplified

From the second list, you can immediately get an actionable list of todo items for your virtual assistant.

That third list is your **optimisation list**. These are tasks you can rework to be more efficient. Start with the low-hanging fruit—what are the tasks you can most easily simplify?—and then move on to the more complex tasks. Working with a virtual assistant is a great way to encourage efficiency in your workflow, because it forces you to make tasks as simple as possible so others can do them!

## Dream projects

In addition to your list of tasks based on what you already do, you should compile a list of "dream projects" and "wish tasks"—things you've always wanted to get done, but never could. Not only does this serve as a great way to take a personal inventory, but it can serve as a way to find new opportunities to use your virtual assistant.

For example, my new website StudioSleuth, a service for [actors who want to find rehearsal space in major cities](http://studiosleuth.com/), was on my "dream project list". I had long wanted to start a simple listing service for actors and performers, but didn't have the time or energy to do the research involved (compiling the database of spaces, maintaining social media, etc). After hiring my virtual assistant, I was able to make this project a reality, by delegating those tasks to her. My contributions to StudioSleuth are the site's concept, design, and code, but the actual content of the site is based on research my assistant completed. She also handles the site's modest social media presence, tweeting and posting links to the "studio of the week."

Additionally, I'm developing a blog for StudioSleuth, and I have hired a writer to complete weekly blog posts. This is a perfect example of how you can delegate almost any task related to building a website, if you're willing to make the investment.

## Data and insights

A third opportunity for delegation is to have your virtual assistant create reports based on data you already collect. This may already be on one of your lists, but if not it's worth considering. As a web professional, you probably have dozens of types of data at your disposal: website analytics, social media numbers, and more. And if you're anything like me, you probably largely ignore (or forget about) these numbers.

The answer is easy: have your virtual assistant parse the numbers for you, and compile daily or weekly reports. You're more likely to read them because they'll only contain the metrics that you care about, and you can have your VA include some human-generated insights ("sales increased X% this week, after you had me add the new page to the website on Thursday", for instance). Having a human sift through your data for actionable insights—before you ever see it—is a great way to make sure you're always improving and using your VA to the fullest.

## Delegated bliss

Hopefully you now have a few ideas of what you can delegate to your virtual assistant. Stop doing the tasks you hate, and start focusing on making those dream projects a reality!
