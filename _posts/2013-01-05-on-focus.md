title: On Focus
---

Although I try not to dwell on the past, occasionally it's helpful to consider mistakes and figure out where to improve in the time ahead.

One area that I've been contemplating a lot lately is how Van Patten Media can double down and **focus**. It's particularly tricky because I have a difficult time articulating exactly what Van Patten Media is and what I want it to be. We make websites for clients, we build open source software, and we have "side" projects that help web developers and theatre people make the most of the web.

Figuring out our focus is a key theme for Van Patten Media in 2013. I want us to become lighter, more agile, and more profitable, and figuring out exactly what we do is the first step on that road. We've been burdened in the past by taking on clients who we don't mesh with, or who may be better served by other development teams.

No more. In 2013, we're going to figure out who we are and what we're fighting for.
