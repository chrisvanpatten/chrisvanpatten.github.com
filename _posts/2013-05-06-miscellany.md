Twenty-thirteen is well under way, and—seeing as how my last blog post was in the beginning of January—things have been, well, busy. Between migrating to a new city (hello New York!), taking on a large new client (hello OffBroadway.com!), and growing Van Patten Media, I've barely had time to breathe.

Finally though, things are slowing down (a bit) now that I've finished a few big events and projects, so I thought I'd take a second to talk about some random things that are on my mind.

## iPhone

I recently gave in, gave up my Android device, and migrated to iOS (on an iPhone 4S). Overall, I've been pleasantly surprised at just how smooth the transition has gone, and how well I'm able to cope without many of the Android features I had grown accustomed to. Still, there are a few things I miss:

+ **Intents.** The lack of a proper system of intents in iOS is a serious disadvantage. URL Schemes are a hack (at best) and Apple's stubborn lack of movement on this critical feature has severely crippled some potentially brilliant app interactions.
+ **Useful notifications.** I find myself losing notifications, forgetting about notifications, and just generally hating the way notifications were implemented in iOS. Android's notifications system is one of its strongest features, especially in Ice Cream Sandwich and Jellybean.
+ **Deep Google integration.** I use almost every major Google service (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, etc.) and very much miss the tight integration on Android. (In fairness, this is a problem that I don't see getting a fix, and completely understand why.)

I have other quibbles too (restrictive App Store policies, inability to set default app handlers, etc.) but in general I'm so happy I made the switch. Someday—when device manufacturers are producing more manageably sized devices and Verizon is again in Google's good graces and can sell a true Nexus device—I may return to Android. The Android experience, if you're able to use a Nexus device, is actually quite polished and much less dire than Apple apologists would have you believe. Unfortunately, Nexus devices just aren't an option for me (thanks Verizon), so I got the next best thing.

## New York City

I have an apartment in the Big Apple! I'm so excited to be here among so many exceptionally talented and wonderful people who are inspiring me to work harder and faster all the time. I've already made several wonderful friends and established connections that I hope to maintain for a long time to come.

## Pagecraft

I'm excited to be leading an awesome team building a new web app for actors called [Pagecraft](http://pagecraftapp.com/). Pagecraft is a simple tool for actors who want to build their own websites. We'll be launching in the next week (and I'll be talking about it _a lot_) so stay tuned.

## OffBroadway.com

Part of the reason I now have an apartment in New York City (aside from the fact that all my friends live here) was to become the new editor-in-chief of [OffBroadway.com](http://www.offbroadway.com), "the official online home of Off-Broadway". Part of the reason I was brought on board was to overhaul and refocus the website, which we've started doing thanks to a brand new design (by Van Patten Media) and a seriously-expanded social media presence.

Last night was my first visit to the Lortel Awards (the Tony Awards of Off-Broadway) and had an absolute blast covering the ceremony for the site. It was also great to see so many friends and colleagues out in full force, and hear so many great comments on the redesign (and rubbing shoulders with TV and film celebs is always fun too).

## Looking forward

The next few months are busy (no surprise) with all sorts of work, new projects, and experiences. I'm happy to have some of the best friends in the world and the best family to keep me sane. Things are picking up for Van Patten Media, and I couldn't be happier to be where I am today.
