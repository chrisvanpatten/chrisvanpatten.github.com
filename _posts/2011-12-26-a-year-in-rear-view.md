> Italy, and the spring and first love all together should suffice to make the gloomiest person happy.

It has been a long year.

I opened the year with (what turned out to be) my last [KCACTF](http://kcactf2.org/) festival, directing for the Student Directing Institute. Then I ended up directing and designing [my own play at school](http://www.chrisvanpatten.com/altakesabride/). Not long after I found myself in New York City working for [A+E Networks](http://www.aetn.com/), all the while picking up countless freelance design clients like [LML Music](http://www.lmlmusic.com/), [Cortney Wolfson](http://www.cortneywolfson.com/), and more.

School in the fall was just as busy. Even though I had commitments to school projects, [the clients kept coming](http://www.vanpattenmedia.com/portfolio/), and I decided to drop a few projects to focus on web work. And as the end of the semester approached, I decided (1) to focus the spring on growing what was now a fully-formed [Van Patten Media](http://www.vanpattenmedia.com/) and (2) to apply to go on a three week study-abroad trip in Italy.

Phew.

And today, on Monday December 26th, the day of my departure, as I sit awake in a mostly-asleep house typing away, I'm tired. I am as tired as the year has been long. I truly love my clients, and have been thrilled for the opportunity to work with each and every one of them. I very much believe you learn something from every person you encounter, and my clients have taught me so much.

But man was not made to balance school and work commitments. Even the greats (*yes, I'm reading the* [Steve Jobs](http://amzn.to/tbcKHA) *book...*) let one slide, and to an extent my focus has certainly shifted in one direction. But I still try to balance. I have one more semester left; I can't quit now. It's to a point where I have a twitch in my eye that's probably caused from all the work. In fact, I just spent a madcap week finishing (or getting to a comfortable place) three major website projects, so I would feel comfortable leaving on this trip.

This trip is all too exciting though. Although it is a study abroad experience, the work takes place in the spring so I can relax, enjoy the sights, and take in Italia. We'll see Naples, Rome, Pompeii, and dozens of sights throughout the course of the three weeks. In the second week of the trip, we have a two night break; I've booked a fairly cushy hotel so I can just relax. And before I come home, I'll be spending a night in London where I'm planning to visit friends and see the West End production of [Matilda the Musical](http://www.matildathemusical.com/). This vacation is for me.

There are a lot of exciting things coming for [Van Patten Media](http://www.vanpattenmedia.com). As I keep reiterating (because it is true) we have absolutely mind-blowingly awesome clients. In 2012, I'm focused on growing our corporate clients, to help boost our bottom line. We've just [open sourced two projects](http://www.github.com/vanpattenmedia), and have more on the way in the new year.

In order to make it all happen though, I need a break. A little time to stop, re-evaluate where I am, where I am going, and how best to get there. I'm bringing my copy of *The Four-Hour Workweek* (after just working a 90 hour week, I like the sound of it). I'll have my ebooks of *[Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind](http://amzn.to/vW2fE3)* ([free PDF](http://lumsa.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/zen_mind_beginners_mind.pdf)), *[Mindfulness in Plain English](http://amzn.to/t8XkuE)* ([free ePub/PDF](http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe.html)), and [Julien Smith](http://inoveryourhead.net/)'s *[The Flinch](http://www.amazon.com/The-Flinch-ebook/dp/B0062Q7S3S/)* (it's just free, so go read it). I will be resting and recharging, but I will also be deep in thought, planning and plotting for the year to come.

Oh, and of course I'll also be enjoying all the excellent food. Because at the end of the day, it *is* Italy. That's really what this trip is going to be all about.

Ciao!
