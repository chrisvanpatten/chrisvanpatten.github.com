**Van Patten Media** has really been busy lately!

I just posted our [second week in review](http://www.vanpattenmedia.com/2012/one-week-more-vpm-week-in-review/).Â See what we've been up to the past seven days (and if you really care, [the seven days before that](http://www.vanpattenmedia.com/2012/week-in-review-january-20-26/)).

For those who don't know, Van Patten Media is the [website design](http://www.vanpattenmedia.com/) firm I run. We're targeted toward actors and theatre people, but have worked and continue to work with just about anyone. We also have a strong commitment to the [open source software](http://labs.vanpattenmedia.com/) community. And we love [WordPress](http://www.vanpattenmedia.com/how/websites/).

We're available for March and beyond - feel free to [contact Van Patten Media](http://www.vanpattenmedia.com/contact/) directly for more info.
