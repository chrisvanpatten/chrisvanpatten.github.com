2012 was a busy and tumultuous year, starting with a trip to Italy and ending with my departure from Buffalo.

I made many friends, lost others, and got closer to some I already had.

I do not want to dwell too much on the year that passed, except to acknowledge that I am grateful for all the opportunities, experiences, and chances to grow. I hope that 2013 brings adventures that meet (and exceed) the standards set by 2012.

Here's to what's next. See you on the other side.
