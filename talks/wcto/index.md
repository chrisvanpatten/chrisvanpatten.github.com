Hi WordCamp Toronto: Developers! I'm so glad I had the chance to come speak to you about this topic I'm so passionate about.

You can find the slides [at this link](https://speakerdeck.com/chrisvanpatten/developing-a-client-focused-admin-panel). I'll also be adding a link to a Github repo with code examples of everything I showed, so you can experiment yourself.

Thanks!
Chris
