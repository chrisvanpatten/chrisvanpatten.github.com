Hi WordCamp Toronto: Developers!

I'm so glad I had the chance to come speak to you about this topic I'm so passionate about.

You can find the slides [at this link](https://speakerdeck.com/chrisvanpatten/developing-a-client-focused-admin-panel). I've also put up a Github repo (that you can contribute to!) containing [code samples of everything I showed off](https://github.com/vanpattenmedia/wp-custom-admin).

If you have any questions, [don't hesitate to get in touch](mailto:chris+wcto@vanpattenmedia.com).

Thanks!<br>
Chris
