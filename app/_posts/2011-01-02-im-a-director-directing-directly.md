So the "semester of directing" I alluded to in my last post has come to fruition! I'll be directing Gary Sunshine's short play AL TAKES A BRIDE this coming spring at the University at Buffalo. The production goes up April 2nd. Exciting stuff!

I'm also participating in the Kennedy Center American College Theatre Festival's Region 2 Student Directing Institute. I choose a short scene (I chose the end of Act Two in UNCLE VANYA) and get four days to cast, rehearse, and stage the scene for presentation on the fourth day. There are various workshops and classes interspersed throughout, and it's a thrilling chance to discover my strengths and weaknesses as a director in a compact period of time.

So that's the semester o' directing that lies ahead. Now to line up a summer o' directing...
