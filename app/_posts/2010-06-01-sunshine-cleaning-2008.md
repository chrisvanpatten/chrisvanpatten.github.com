The past few years have proven that there's a place for quirk in popular culture, and "[Sunshine Cleaning](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0862846/)" is no exception. This indie dramedy, starring favorites [Amy Adams](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0010736/), [Emily Blunt](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1289434/), and [Alan Arkin](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000273/), gives us the story of a woman's quest to find herself.

Typical.

But it's the quirk that sets any indie flick apart (naturally), and "Sunshine Cleaning" delivers. Add in some blood and guts, an affair with a cop, and a witty-beyond-his-years kid and you have a film. Is it formulaic? Sure. There's little doubt that "Sunshine Cleaning" checks all the boxes on the "quirky indie movie" checklist, but it rarely manages to feel like it does. Through the strength of its performers (Amy Adams and Emily Blunt carry this movie), the movie transcends its genre and becomes much more memorable.

4.5 out of 5 stars.
