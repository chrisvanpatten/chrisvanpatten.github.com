For the curious, nosy, or just plain bored, I've posted pictures of my December/January trip to Europe (primarily central/south Italy) on Picasa.

The pictures are broken up into three galleries:

  * [The Journey to Italy and a week in (and around) Naples](https://picasaweb.google.com/113866151716680717173/TheJourneyToItalyAndAWeekInAndAroundNaples?authkey=Gv1sRgCOy-n_Ox4JLptQE)
  * [The Journey to (and two weeks in and around) Rome](https://picasaweb.google.com/113866151716680717173/TheJourneyToAndTwoWeeksInAndAroundRome?authkey=Gv1sRgCOCwiYG-itq7GQ)
  * [The Journey to (and a night in) London, Matilda, and the trip Home](https://picasaweb.google.com/113866151716680717173/TheJourneyToAndANightInLondonMatildaAndTheTripHome?authkey=Gv1sRgCLTRh7zU_v7ElgE)

All the pictures were taken from my phone, a rooted [HTC Thunderbolt](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5HB6U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=chrvanpat-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004M5HB6U)Â (affiliate link). For the majority of the trip I used the stock camera app, but midway through the trip (I believe in Rome?) I installed [HDR Camera+](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.almalence.hdr_plus) which got impressive results.
